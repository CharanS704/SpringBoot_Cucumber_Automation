 - RestAssured - To interact with the API's and validate the response as per the requests.
- Page Object Model - Design pattern supporting modular approach i.e segregate the assertion logic from page elements and hence increase in code readability and reducing redundant code.
- DataTable & Examples - To provide the test data to the scenarios.
- Syncronization - To apply smart waits as required for smooth execution.
- Locators - To locate the webelements in order to perform actions.
- Extent Report - An open-source reporting library for test automation that generates detailed HTML reports.
